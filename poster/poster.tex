	\begin{block}{Elliptic Curves}
		An \textbf{elliptic curve} is a set of points satisfying an equation of the form
		$$y^2 = x^3 + ax + b$$
		for coefficients $a,b$ and variables $x,y$ in some field $F$ (of characteristic not 2 or 3). 
		This type of equation is a Weierstrass equation, which is a condensed form of a general cubic equation.
		One additional restriction is placed on an elliptic curve, which is that
		$4a^3 + 27b^2 \neq 0$.
		This condition ensures that the curve is \textit{non-singular}, which allows us to find a tangent line to any point on the curve.

		Figure \ref{fig:ec-plot} shows a simple elliptic curve.

	\begin{block}{The Group Law}
		Define the set of points on the curve as
		$$C = \{(x,y) \mid x,y \in F \text{ and } y^2 = x^3 + ax + b\} \cup \infty$$%
		where $\infty$ is the point at infinity in the projective plane.

		There is an operation $+$ which allows the composition of any two points on the curve.
		Figure \ref{fig:ec-plus} shows the geometric application of this operation.

		To add two points together, take the line between them and find its third point of intersection with the curve, then reflect across the $x$-axis.
		To add a point to itself, use the tangent line.
		The identity of $+$ is $\infty$. The inverse of a point is its reflection across the $x$-axis.

	\begin{block}{The Discrete Logarithm Problem}
		Given a group $G$ with operation $*$ we can define a map $\cdot: \mathbb{Z} \times G \to G$ by
		$$n\cdot g \mapsto \underbrace{g * g * \cdots * g}_{n\text{ times}}$$
		On an elliptic curve, the map $\cdot$ is equal to the repeated addition of a point to itself. 
		We call this map \textit{point multiplication}.
		For a point $P$ on $C$, $nP = P + P + \cdots + P$.
		If we have two points $P,Q$ on $C$ where $nP = Q$, then $n$ is the \textit{elliptic-curve discrete logarithm} (ECDL) of $Q$ with respect to $P$.

		Point multiplication is an example of a \textit{trap-door function}: a function which is simple to compute in one direction but difficult to compute in the other direction.
		This is the exact operation we will use to construct a cryptosystem.

		\vskip1ex
        \noindent{\textbf{Naive Multiplication}} \\
		If an attacker knows $P$ and $nP$, where $N$ is the order of $C$, then they can solve the discrete logarithm problem by testing if $mP = nP$ for each $m$, $1 \leq m < N$.
		This is the simplest attack on the ECDLP, and will complete in $O(NM)$ time, where $M$ is the cost of an elliptic curve multiplication.

		For small curves, a computer performing naive multiplication will quickly solve the ECDLP. 
		Generic attacks against the ECDLP all have complexity which is a function of the order of the curve, so cryptographic curves are picked such that their order is very large: more than $2^{200}$.

		\vskip1ex
		\noindent{\textbf{Baby-Step Giant-Step}} \\
		The Baby-Step Giant-Step algorithm rewrites the point $Q = nP$ as $(im + j)P$, with $m = \lceil \sqrt{N} \rceil$.
		Then $jP$ is computed for $0 \leq j < m$ and stored.
		Finally, naive multiplication is used to find $imP$ for $0 \leq i < m$, and subtracted from $nP$ to solve for $jP$.

		\caption*{Baby-Step Giant-Step for ECDLP}
		\begin{algorithmic}
		\State $m \gets \sqrt{N}$
		\For{$0 \leq j < m$}
			\State Compute and store $(j, jP)$
		\EndFor
		\For{$0 \leq i < m$}
			\State Compute $Q - imP$
			\If{$Q-imP = jP$ for some $j$}
				\State \Return $n \equiv j + im$
			\EndIf
		\EndFor
		\end{algorithmic}
		\end{algorithm}
		\end{minipage}
		}
		\vskip0.5ex

		Baby-Step Giant-Step completes in $O(\sqrt{N} M)$ time and $O(\sqrt{N})$ space complexity.
		This is a large improvement over naive multiplication, but still very slow on cryptographic curves. 
		There is no known algorithm which feasibly solves the ECDLP on a generic cryptographic curve, and this problem is what elliptic curve cryptography is based on.
